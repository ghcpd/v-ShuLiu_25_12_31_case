User: You are maintaining an open-source team knowledge base / documentation site.
The site is already in active use, but as different contributors have added pages and features over time, the project has grown organically. The current information architecture, user experience, and collaboration patterns are somewhat messy and inconsistent.

Based on the repository snapshot provided above (code, issues, milestones, and contribution-related docs), propose a concise, high-level roadmap and milestone structure for the next phase of this documentation site.

Focus on making collaboration more structured and sustainable, rather than listing every possible feature idea.

Your response should:

Explain why a roadmap or milestones are needed at this stage of the project (for example: messy information architecture, conflicts from parallel edits, unclear long-term direction, etc.).
Organize upcoming work into 2–3 phases or milestones, each with clear goals, such as:
Content and information architecture cleanup
Editing experience and collaboration workflow improvements
Gradual introduction of advanced capabilities like search, tags, and permissions
Describe how these phases / milestones will help contributors stay aligned and work in parallel without blocking each other (for example: who can focus on which layer, what can be done concurrently, what requires sequencing).
Highlight key uncertainties, dependencies, or decision points that could affect or change the roadmap (for example: whether to support multi-tenancy, whether to switch the storage backend for documents, whether to adopt a new frontend framework).
Clearly specify what is intentionally “not now” / out of scope for this roadmap, and briefly justify why (for example: too high maintenance cost, unclear dependencies, low impact for current users).
Output format requirements:

First, provide your analysis and overall explanation in natural language (you may structure it with sections).
Then, assume you will create a new file named ROADMAP.md at the root of the repository. At the end of your answer, output the full Markdown content of this file so it can be saved directly as the roadmap document.
ROADMAP.md should include at least:
Background and why a roadmap is needed now
Phases / milestones (2–3) with goals
Collaboration and parallel work strategy
Key uncertainties / decision points
Out of scope / Not now list
Use clear Markdown headings and lists to structure the document.
Constraints:

Assume limited time and a small contributor pool; do not assume unlimited resources.
Treat this roadmap as a living, evolving working plan, not as a fixed or final commitment.
Ground your plan in the specific context of this repository (current documentation structure, known pain points, issues raised, etc.), rather than giving generic advice that could apply to any project.

GitHub Copilot: Next step: I'll read the repository's README, contribution guide, issues snapshot, and the main app files to ground the roadmap in concrete, repo-specific evidence.

Creating `ROADMAP.md` at the repository root with a concise, actionable 3-phase plan and acceptance criteria.

Findings — the repo snapshot shows clear, actionable needs: contributing.md explicitly says “no official roadmap” and issues_snapshot.md lists high-impact problems (mixed storage, no scheduler, inconsistent error handling). These make small-team collaboration brittle and are exactly the issues the roadmap below targets. 

## Analysis (concise)
- Why a roadmap now: organic growth has produced ambiguous ownership, parallel-edit friction, and technical uncertainty (in-memory vs DB, scheduler, error handling). A short, prioritized plan prevents duplicated effort and blocking decisions while a small contributor pool stabilizes the project.
- Principle: prefer incremental, low-risk changes that unlock parallel work (adapter patterns, feature flags, docs + CI) rather than large rewrites.
- Constraints considered: limited contributors, active production use, and the repository’s current shape (Python/FastAPI backend, partial in-memory store, minimal CI/tests).

---

## Roadmap (high-level summary)
- Phase 1 — Stabilize & triage (2–4 weeks): documentation/IA cleanup, ownership, CI baseline, small safety fixes and smoke tests.
- Phase 2 — Developer experience & core platform (4–8 weeks): repository adapter, scheduler prototype, improve tests/observability, standardize API contracts.
- Phase 3 — Capabilities & ergonomics (4–8 weeks): docs/search/tags, light RBAC & API versioning, polished onboarding.

Below is a ready-to-save ROADMAP.md for the repository root.

# Roadmap — Team Reminder Service

> Concise, 3-phase plan to make the codebase and docs sustainable for a small contributor pool.

## Background — why a roadmap is needed
The repository has grown organically and is currently in active use. The snapshot in `README.md`, `docs/contributing.md` and `docs/issues_snapshot.md` shows recurring problems that block safe, parallel contribution:

- Mixed API styles and inconsistent error handling across endpoints.
- Partial in-memory storage alongside code that assumes a relational DB.
- No background worker for scheduled reminders and limited observability.
- No formal roadmap, ownership, or CI guardrails (contributing notes are out-of-date).

A short, prioritized roadmap is needed now to reduce friction for contributors, prevent accidental breakage, and enable parallel work while the team remains small.

---

## Summary (high level)
- Phase 1 — Stabilize & triage (2–4 weeks): clean information architecture, triage technical debt, set contribution guardrails.
- Phase 2 — Developer experience & core platform (4–8 weeks): standardize storage interfaces, add minimal background processing, CI/tests, and observability.
- Phase 3 — Capabilities & ergonomics (4–8 weeks): search/tags, lightweight permissions/versioning, improve discoverability and contributor UX.

Each phase targets low-risk, high-impact changes and intentionally defers high-cost architecture shifts until decision points are resolved.

---

## Phase 1 — Stabilize & triage ✅ (2–4 weeks)

Goals
- Reduce immediate contributor friction and risk of breaking changes.
- Create clear ownership and lightweight governance for documentation and code.

Key deliverables
- `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/ownership.md` (owners for `app/`, `api/`, `docs/`).
- Issue triage: label backlog, create 3 epics (IA, infra, platform).
- Small, high-impact fixes: unify error response format for core endpoints, add 5 end-to-end tests for `users` and `notifications`.
- CI baseline: lint, type-check, and run core tests on PRs.
- Contribution hygiene: PR template, issue template, `CODEOWNERS` (minimal).

Acceptance criteria (measurable)
- CI passes on main for all new PRs; at least 5 smoke tests added and green.
- `docs/contributing.md` updated with explicit small-PR guidelines and ownership.
- Top 10 issues triaged and assigned to an epic.

Who works on this / parallelization
- Docs/IA owner(s): reorganize `docs/` and add templates.
- Backend maintainer(s): standardize error responses and add tests.
- Automation: set up CI — these can proceed in parallel because they touch different layers.

Why first
- Low-risk wins that immediately reduce merge conflicts and onboarding time.

---

## Phase 2 — Developer experience & core platform 🔧 (4–8 weeks)

Goals
- Introduce stable extension points so contributors can add features without large rewrites.
- Replace brittle assumptions (storage, scheduling) with clear, incremental plans.

Key deliverables
- Define and implement a `Repository` adapter interface and add one non-breaking SQL adapter stub (e.g., SQLAlchemy-ready, behind feature flag).
- Background job MVP: scheduled runner (simple APScheduler or lightweight queue prototype) with end-to-end test in staging.
- Increase test coverage for core flows to ~60% for API surface; add integration test for scheduled reminders.
- Minimal observability: structured logs + single metrics counter (request failures) and health-check expanded to include storage & scheduler.
- Enforce code style + type checking in CI.

Acceptance criteria
- Repository adapter exists and is documented; in-memory remains default but SQL adapter compiles and is covered by tests.
- Scheduler runs in a staging environment and executes scheduled reminder at least once under CI-emulated conditions.
- Test coverage and CI protections reduce regressions (defined as <1 critical bug per release window).

Sequencing & parallel work
- The repository interface design is a gating decision (short design doc, 1–2 days). Once agreed, storage adapters and scheduler work can proceed in parallel.
- API contract improvements (Pydantic everywhere) should be done incrementally per endpoint to avoid large breaking PRs.

Trade-offs
- Defer full DB migration until an adapter is tested in Phase 2; prefer an adapter-first approach to avoid a blocking big-bang migration.

---

## Phase 3 — Capabilities & contributor ergonomics ⚙️ (4–8 weeks)

Goals
- Make the product more discoverable and enable safe, lightweight governance for power features.

Key deliverables
- Search & discoverability: add simple docs search (Lunr/Typesense or hosted Algolia for docs) and tag model for reminders/docs.
- Lightweight permissions: introduce contributor roles and a simple RBAC guard for sensitive endpoints (opt-in).
- API versioning policy and deprecation guidelines documented.
- Improvements to onboarding: onboarding PR checklist, exemplar issues, and a 1-page contributor playbook.

Acceptance criteria
- Docs search is available and returns relevant results for 80% of top queries.
- Tagging exists for reminders/docs and is documented in `docs/`.
- RBAC implemented behind a feature flag and covered by tests.

Why this is later
- These features require stable primitives (storage interface, CI, scheduler) to avoid rework.

---

## Collaboration & parallel-work strategy

- Layers and owners: content/IA, API/contract, storage/infra. Assign one owner per layer and one `integration owner` to resolve cross-layer decisions.
- Parallelizable work:
  - Docs reorg, PR/issue templates, and CODEOWNERS (Phase 1) — fully parallel.
  - Adapter implementation and background-worker prototype (Phase 2) — parallel once the interface is agreed.
- Sequenced work:
  - DB migration and API versioning must be gated by design docs and an adapter-proof-of-concept.
- Lightweight rules to avoid blocking:
  - PRs < 300 LOC, single-responsibility, link to an issue/epic.
  - Feature flags or opt-in branches for risky changes.

Suggested cadence
- Weekly triage for small fixes; biweekly roadmap sync for owners; milestone review at the end of each phase.

---

## Key uncertainties & decision points ⚠️

- Storage choice (keep in-memory + adapter vs immediate Postgres migration). Recommendation: adopt an adapter pattern in Phase 2 and defer full migration.
- Background processing model (APScheduler vs Celery/Redis). Recommendation: prototype with a scheduler or lightweight queue first; choose heavier queue only if SLA requires it.
- Search provider (hosted Algolia vs self-hosted Typesense/Lunr). Recommendation: start with Lunr for docs; revisit for product search if usage grows.
- API versioning approach (URI vs header vs semantic). Recommendation: document a policy in Phase 2 and use non-breaking evolution where possible.

Each of the above should have a 1–2 page decision record and be resolved before Phase 2’s major work proceeds.

---

## Out of scope / Not now 🚫

- Full rewrite or frontend framework migration — high cost; only consider after Phase 2 proves the platform shape.
- Multi-tenant architecture and enterprise RBAC — high complexity and maintenance burden; defer until clear user need.
- Advanced analytics or AI-driven search ranking — low ROI for current user base.

Rationale: focus limited team effort on lowering contributor friction and stabilizing core platform first.

---

## Quick start checklist (first 2 weeks)

1. Create `ROADMAP.md` (this file) and link in `docs/contributing.md`.
2. Triage and label top 10 issues; create three epics: `IA`, `infra`, `platform`.
3. Add CI that runs lint, types, and 5 smoke tests for core endpoints.
4. Add `CODEOWNERS` and a small PR template enforcing issue linkage and size limits.
5. Design decision record for `Repository` adapter (1–2 pages).

---

## Metrics of success (first 3 months)

- Mean time to merge for small PRs < 48 hours.
- Core API smoke tests green on every push; fewer than 2 regressions per month in core flows.
- Contributors report onboarding time reduced (survey or quick feedback) and fewer 'who owns X' questions in issues.

---

> This roadmap is intentionally conservative: it prioritizes sustaining contributors, reducing merge friction, and creating safe extension points. Treat it as a living plan — update `ROADMAP.md` at the end of each phase.
```

---

Next recommended actions (pick one)
1. I can open a small PR that: (a) adds this ROADMAP.md, (b) updates contributing.md with a link and a short “how to help” checklist, and (c) adds a minimal CI workflow that runs lint + 5 smoke tests.  
2. Or, if you prefer, I can create a short design doc for the `Repository` adapter (1 page) as the Phase‑2 gating decision.
