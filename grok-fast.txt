User: You are maintaining an open-source team knowledge base / documentation site.
The site is already in active use, but as different contributors have added pages and features over time, the project has grown organically. The current information architecture, user experience, and collaboration patterns are somewhat messy and inconsistent.

Based on the repository snapshot provided above (code, issues, milestones, and contribution-related docs), propose a concise, high-level roadmap and milestone structure for the next phase of this documentation site.

Focus on making collaboration more structured and sustainable, rather than listing every possible feature idea.

Your response should:

Explain why a roadmap or milestones are needed at this stage of the project (for example: messy information architecture, conflicts from parallel edits, unclear long-term direction, etc.).
Organize upcoming work into 2–3 phases or milestones, each with clear goals, such as:
Content and information architecture cleanup
Editing experience and collaboration workflow improvements
Gradual introduction of advanced capabilities like search, tags, and permissions
Describe how these phases / milestones will help contributors stay aligned and work in parallel without blocking each other (for example: who can focus on which layer, what can be done concurrently, what requires sequencing).
Highlight key uncertainties, dependencies, or decision points that could affect or change the roadmap (for example: whether to support multi-tenancy, whether to switch the storage backend for documents, whether to adopt a new frontend framework).
Clearly specify what is intentionally “not now” / out of scope for this roadmap, and briefly justify why (for example: too high maintenance cost, unclear dependencies, low impact for current users).
Output format requirements:

First, provide your analysis and overall explanation in natural language (you may structure it with sections).
Then, assume you will create a new file named ROADMAP.md at the root of the repository. At the end of your answer, output the full Markdown content of this file so it can be saved directly as the roadmap document.
ROADMAP.md should include at least:
Background and why a roadmap is needed now
Phases / milestones (2–3) with goals
Collaboration and parallel work strategy
Key uncertainties / decision points
Out of scope / Not now list
Use clear Markdown headings and lists to structure the document.
Constraints:

Assume limited time and a small contributor pool; do not assume unlimited resources.
Treat this roadmap as a living, evolving working plan, not as a fixed or final commitment.
Ground your plan in the specific context of this repository (current documentation structure, known pain points, issues raised, etc.), rather than giving generic advice that could apply to any project.

## Analysis and Roadmap Proposal

### Why a Roadmap is Needed Now
The Team Reminder Service has evolved organically from a simple script into a functional backend used by internal teams, but this growth has introduced several structural issues that hinder sustainable development and collaboration. Key pain points include inconsistent API styles (some endpoints use Pydantic models while others return raw dicts), mixed error handling and HTTP status codes, unclear separation of business logic between route handlers and services, and a hybrid storage approach that partially relies on in-memory data while expecting relational database support. Additionally, there's no background processing for scheduled reminders, limited observability (logging, metrics), and no clear API versioning strategy. These inconsistencies lead to parallel edit conflicts, unclear module ownership (e.g., services.py vs. repositories.py), and difficulty onboarding new contributors. Without a structured roadmap, future features risk exacerbating these issues, potentially breaking existing clients and increasing maintenance overhead for a small contributor pool.

### Proposed Phases and Milestones
I've organized the roadmap into three phases, focusing on consolidation and incremental improvements rather than ambitious feature additions. Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing for parallel work where possible while sequencing interdependent changes.

1. **Foundation Consolidation** (1-2 months): Standardize core infrastructure and data handling to eliminate inconsistencies. Goals include unifying API response formats, implementing consistent error handling across all endpoints, and completing the storage layer migration to a relational database. This phase addresses the "organic growth" mess by establishing clear patterns for new code.

2. **Reliability and Automation** (2-3 months): Enhance operational reliability and user experience through background processing and observability. Goals include adding a background worker for scheduled reminders, implementing basic logging and metrics, and expanding test coverage. This phase focuses on making the service more dependable for teams relying on timely notifications.

3. **Advanced Capabilities** (3-4 months): Introduce structured evolution mechanisms like API versioning and improved collaboration tools. Goals include establishing an API versioning strategy, adding basic user permissions, and refining the development setup for better contributor experience. This phase enables sustainable growth without overcomplicating the current scope.

### Collaboration and Parallel Work Strategy
With a small contributor pool, the roadmap emphasizes parallel work to maximize efficiency. In Phase 1, contributors can work concurrently on different API modules (e.g., one on users endpoints, another on notifications) while a dedicated person handles storage standardization. Services and repositories can be refactored independently as long as they align with the new standards. Phase 2 allows parallel development of background workers and observability tools, with testing spread across contributors. Phase 3 can involve concurrent work on versioning (backend-focused) and permissions (potentially frontend if added later). Sequencing is needed for storage migration (must complete before advanced features) and API versioning (requires stable foundations). Clear module ownership (e.g., assign "storage lead" for repositories.py) and regular sync meetings will prevent conflicts.

### Key Uncertainties and Decision Points
- **Storage Backend**: Whether to standardize on PostgreSQL (widely used, good FastAPI integration) or keep it flexible. This affects Phase 1 timeline and requires evaluating current data needs.
- **Task Queue for Background Jobs**: Choice between Celery (feature-rich but complex) or a simpler solution like APScheduler. Depends on scaling needs and contributor expertise.
- **Observability Stack**: Minimum viable setup (structured logging + basic metrics) vs. adopting tools like Prometheus. Influenced by deployment environment and monitoring preferences.
- **API Versioning Approach**: In-place evolution vs. explicit versioning (e.g., /v1/ prefixes). Affects client migration strategy and backward compatibility.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Whether to introduce team isolation now or defer. Tied to user growth and security requirements.

### Out of Scope / Not Now
- Audit logs and advanced analytics: Too high maintenance cost for current usage; low impact compared to core reliability.
- Complex multi-tenancy features: Unclear dependencies on user growth; could complicate the simple team-focused design.
- Frontend interface: Current backend-only scope; adding UI would require additional resources and shift focus from API stability.
- Advanced integrations (e.g., Slack, email providers beyond basic notifications): Nice-to-have but not critical for existing users; can be added later if demand grows.

This roadmap treats the service as a living plan, adaptable based on contributor feedback and changing needs. It prioritizes high-impact, low-risk improvements to make collaboration more structured without overwhelming the small team.

# Roadmap for Team Reminder Service

## Background and Why a Roadmap is Needed Now

The Team Reminder Service has grown organically from a simple internal script into a backend used by multiple teams for scheduling and sending notifications. While functional, this evolution has led to inconsistencies that complicate maintenance and collaboration:

- Mixed API styles with inconsistent error handling and response formats
- Hybrid storage implementation (in-memory + partial database support)
- No background processing for scheduled reminders
- Limited observability and testing
- Unclear ownership of modules and no standardized development practices

These issues cause parallel edit conflicts, onboarding challenges for new contributors, and reliability concerns for users. With a small contributor pool, a structured roadmap is essential to align efforts, prevent feature creep, and ensure sustainable growth without breaking existing functionality.

## Phases / Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation Consolidation (1-2 months)
**Goals:**
- Standardize API response formats and error handling across all endpoints
- Complete migration from in-memory to relational database storage
- Establish clear code patterns for new features (e.g., Pydantic models, typed responses)

This phase addresses core inconsistencies to create a stable base for future work.

### Phase 2: Reliability and Automation (2-3 months)
**Goals:**
- Implement background worker for scheduled reminders
- Add basic observability (structured logging, request tracing, health checks)
- Expand test coverage for critical endpoints and services

This phase improves operational reliability and user trust in automated notifications.

### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (3-4 months)
**Goals:**
- Establish API versioning strategy for backward compatibility
- Add basic user permissions and access controls
- Refine development setup and contribution guidelines

This phase enables structured evolution while maintaining simplicity.

## Collaboration and Parallel Work Strategy

With limited contributors, phases allow parallel work on independent modules:
- **Phase 1:** API endpoint teams work concurrently on standardization; dedicated storage lead handles database migration.
- **Phase 2:** Separate teams for background jobs, observability, and testing.
- **Phase 3:** Parallel tracks for versioning (backend) and permissions (if UI added).

Sequencing required for storage (foundation) and versioning (after stability). Regular syncs and clear ownership prevent conflicts.

## Key Uncertainties / Decision Points

- Storage backend choice (PostgreSQL vs. alternatives)
- Task queue selection for background jobs (Celery vs. simpler options)
- Observability stack scope (basic logging vs. full metrics)
- API versioning approach (in-place vs. explicit versions)
- Multi-tenancy timing (now vs. later based on user growth)

## Out of Scope / Not Now

- Audit logs and advanced analytics: High maintenance, low current impact
- Complex multi-tenancy: Unclear dependencies, complicates simple design
- Frontend interface: Shifts focus from API stability
- Advanced integrations (e.g., Slack, email providers): Nice-to-have, not critical yet
