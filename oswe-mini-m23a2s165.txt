User: You are maintaining an open-source team knowledge base / documentation site.
The site is already in active use, but as different contributors have added pages and features over time, the project has grown organically. The current information architecture, user experience, and collaboration patterns are somewhat messy and inconsistent.

Based on the repository snapshot provided above (code, issues, milestones, and contribution-related docs), propose a concise, high-level roadmap and milestone structure for the next phase of this documentation site.

Focus on making collaboration more structured and sustainable, rather than listing every possible feature idea.

Your response should:

Explain why a roadmap or milestones are needed at this stage of the project (for example: messy information architecture, conflicts from parallel edits, unclear long-term direction, etc.).
Organize upcoming work into 2–3 phases or milestones, each with clear goals, such as:
Content and information architecture cleanup
Editing experience and collaboration workflow improvements
Gradual introduction of advanced capabilities like search, tags, and permissions
Describe how these phases / milestones will help contributors stay aligned and work in parallel without blocking each other (for example: who can focus on which layer, what can be done concurrently, what requires sequencing).
Highlight key uncertainties, dependencies, or decision points that could affect or change the roadmap (for example: whether to support multi-tenancy, whether to switch the storage backend for documents, whether to adopt a new frontend framework).
Clearly specify what is intentionally “not now” / out of scope for this roadmap, and briefly justify why (for example: too high maintenance cost, unclear dependencies, low impact for current users).
Output format requirements:

First, provide your analysis and overall explanation in natural language (you may structure it with sections).
Then, assume you will create a new file named ROADMAP.md at the root of the repository. At the end of your answer, output the full Markdown content of this file so it can be saved directly as the roadmap document.
ROADMAP.md should include at least:
Background and why a roadmap is needed now
Phases / milestones (2–3) with goals
Collaboration and parallel work strategy
Key uncertainties / decision points
Out of scope / Not now list
Use clear Markdown headings and lists to structure the document.
Constraints:

Assume limited time and a small contributor pool; do not assume unlimited resources.
Treat this roadmap as a living, evolving working plan, not as a fixed or final commitment.
Ground your plan in the specific context of this repository (current documentation structure, known pain points, issues raised, etc.), rather than giving generic advice that could apply to any project.

GitHub Copilot: Status: preparing a concise, repo-grounded roadmap and will add `ROADMAP.md` to the project root now. Next: create the file with the proposed milestones and measurable deliverables.

## Analysis & plan — why a short roadmap is needed now ✅

- The repo already contains active documentation (docs, README.md, `contributing.md`) but the structure and contributor patterns are inconsistent — this causes duplicate pages, unpredictable PRs, and poor discoverability.
- A focused, small-team roadmap reduces friction by (1) stabilizing content, (2) making edits safe and fast, and (3) adding lightweight discovery — in that order.
- Priorities reflect limited contributor bandwidth: clean and govern first, then improve workflow, then add search/analytics.

---

## Roadmap (summary)
- Phase 1 — Stabilize & Clean: inventory content, consolidate duplicates, add metadata, basic CI checks.
- Phase 2 — Editing Experience & Collaboration: templates, `CODEOWNERS`, PR previews, CI improvements.
- Phase 3 — Discovery & Governance: search, tags, analytics, small governance decisions.

# Documentation Site Roadmap (next phase)

> Concise, prioritized plan to stabilize content, improve collaboration workflows, and add practical discovery features — designed for a small contributor team and incremental delivery. ✅

## Background — why a roadmap now

- The repository has active content (docs, README.md, `contributing.md`) but the information architecture and contributor experience have grown organically and inconsistently.
- Symptoms observed in this snapshot: duplicated/unclear pages, inconsistent metadata and structure, ad-hoc PRs/edits, and no clear discovery/search capability (see `issues_snapshot.md` and `contributing.md`).
- A short, focused roadmap will reduce edit conflicts, make contributions predictable, and enable parallel work without heavy process overhead.

---

## High-level goals (what success looks like)

- Clear, documented information architecture and content ownership for the majority of pages.
- Fast, low-friction editing: templates, CI checks, and preview deployments.
- Reliable discovery: searchable, well-tagged content and measurable improvements in findability.
- Minimal ongoing maintenance overhead for a small contributor pool.

---

## Phases & milestones

### Phase 1 — Stabilize & Clean (priority: high, 3–5 weeks)
Goal: reduce chaos and make the repository reliably editable.
- Inventory content and create a canonical content map (root sections and page owners).
- Remove or consolidate obvious duplicates and add `front-matter`/metadata to pages (title, section, tags, owner).
- Update `contributing.md` with a short doc-editing workflow and add `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` / `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` for docs.
- Add a lightweight CI check: markdownlint + broken-link-checker.

Deliverables
- `docs/CONTENT_MAP.md` (or TOC) + list of 1–2 owners per top-level section
- Updated `contributing.md` and created templates
- CI job that fails PRs with broken links or lint errors

Why first: cleanup creates a stable base for parallel work and makes later features (search, tags) effective.

---

### Phase 2 — Editing experience & collaboration (priority: medium, 3–6 weeks — can overlap with Phase 1)
Goal: speed up safe contributions and reduce review friction.
- Add `CODEOWNERS` for docs sections and define minimal review rules.
- Add doc templates and small UX improvements: page template, metadata checklist, clear naming conventions.
- Implement preview/staging for PRs (GitHub Pages, Netlify preview, or similar) so contributors can see changes before merge.
- Add CI spellcheck and a smoke test for the docs build.

Deliverables
- `CODEOWNERS` entries + updated `contributing.md` review flow
- PR preview deployment and CI pipeline improvements
- Short contributor training doc: "How to edit a page" (one-pager)

Parallelism: content editors can continue Phase 1 cleanup while engineers build CI/preview features.

---

### Phase 3 — Discovery & governance (priority: medium/low, 4–8 weeks — depends on Phase 1+2)
Goal: make content findable and introduce light governance when needed.
- Add search (client-side Lunr or hosted Algolia) and tag-based filters.
- Surface metadata in UI: breadcrumbs, section landing pages, related-articles.
- Add basic analytics (page views, top searches) to guide future prioritization.
- Optional: consider role-based write-protection (only if required by policy).

Deliverables
- Search index + UI for tags/categories
- Analytics dashboard (simple spreadsheet or lightweight tool)
- Decisions recorded for any further governance needs

Why later: search and governance rely on a stable IA and consistent metadata from Phases 1–2.

---

## Collaboration & parallel-work strategy 🔧

- Roles (small team):
  - Content Editors — focus on Phase 1 cleanup, taxonomy, and owner assignments.
  - Engineers/DevOps — implement CI, PR preview, and search integration (Phase 2 & 3).
  - UX/Reviewer — create templates, check metadata consistency, and validate discoverability.

- What can run in parallel:
  - Content inventory + metadata enrichment (Phase 1) AND CI/preview pipeline work (Phase 2).
  - Tagging and search prototype (Phase 3) can be developed against a subset of cleaned pages.

- Sequencing constraints:
  - Phase 1 must be at least partially complete (core IA + metadata) before full search and analytics in Phase 3.
  - `CODEOWNERS` and PR templates should be introduced once section owners are agreed (end of Phase 1).

---

## Key uncertainties & decision points ⚠️

- Search backend: open-source client-side (Lunr) vs hosted (Algolia). Trade-offs: cost, relevance, indexing complexity.
- Hosting / preview platform: GitHub Pages vs Netlify/Vercel for PR previews and redirects.
- Permissions model: do we need write controls beyond `CODEOWNERS`? (only if contributor mix or compliance requires it).
- Scope creep risk: migrating to a new CMS or frontend framework — requires a separate, funded initiative.
- Contributor availability — timeline must remain flexible given a small team.

---

## Out of scope / Not now ❌

- Full CMS migration (e.g., moving to Confluence or an enterprise CMS) — high cost and major migration effort.
- Multi-tenancy or complex RBAC for docs — only consider if there is a clear, funded requirement.
- Paid search services unless budget is approved — prefer a free prototype first.
- Large visual redesign or frontend-framework rewrite — this roadmap focuses on content, workflow, and incremental discovery improvements.

Rationale: each item above adds significant maintenance cost or project risk that exceeds the current project constraints.

---

## Quick measurable milestones / success metrics

- Phase 1 complete: content map + 80% pages have metadata, broken links reduced to 0–2.
- Phase 2 complete: PR preview working, `CODEOWNERS` in place, average docs PR review time ≤ 48 hours.
- Phase 3 complete: search returns relevant results for top 20 queries; tags applied to ≥ 60% of pages.

---

## Next recommended immediate steps (0–2 weeks) ▶️

1. Run a 1–2 day content inventory: produce `docs/CONTENT_MAP.md` and tag obvious duplicates.
2. Add/standardize front-matter metadata on high-traffic pages (top 10).
3. Create `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` + simple CI markdownlint and broken-link checks.
4. Assign owners for top-level sections and add `CODEOWNERS` draft.

## Living document

This roadmap is intended to evolve. Revisit priorities after Phase 1 and update timelines and scope with real contributor capacity and usage metrics.

If you want, I can:
- Commit ROADMAP.md and open a PR with the immediate Phase 1 checklist, or
- Generate `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` and a starter `markdownlint` CI workflow next. Which should I do first?
